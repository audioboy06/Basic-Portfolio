                <p> Welcome to the wonderful, wacky land of Rick's World! A world where it's just as likely that I'll burst out
                    into song or impersonate the Nutty Professor (the original Jerry Lewis version, thank you very much!)
                    as it is that I'll bust out some game changing code for your business!
                </p>
                <p> (In the style of James Lipton)He is a talented coder, musician, and voice actor. He likes Sushi, chocolate,
                    and the occassional deep dive into insanity. Ladies and Gentlemen it is my distinct pleasure to introduce
                    you to.....Richard Joyce!
